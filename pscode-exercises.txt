// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 numbers together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for a number
modulus divide by 2
check whether the remainder is 0 
if yes, return even
if no, return odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a)
ask for five numbers separated by whitespace
store those numbers in an array
b) 
iterate over the array and take the sum of the numbers
divide by 5
c)
bubble sort the array
display the value of the item stored at the array index 0 (minimum)
display the value of the item stored at the array index 4 (maximum)
d)
display a message that the average of the 5 numbers is X
display a message that the smallest of the 5 numbers is y and the largest is z
